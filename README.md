# SI140 (Probability and Statistics) Course Project

School of Information Science and Technology offers this course in Fall 2021. The course is specially designed for information science, rather than pure mathmatical stuff.

This project is about a classical problem in reinforcement learning, named Multi-armed Bandit.

The project is generally divided into three parts:
- Simulation. We have to simulate the multi-armed bandit via different algorithms under a set of given parameters and show the output, i.e., the performance of the bandit.
- Analysis. We have to analyze the impact of each hyperparameter of each algorithm. Additionally, we have to analyze an important problem in the multi-armed bandit problem, that is, the exploration-exploitation trade-off problem.
- Design. We have to handle some variants of the classical scenario, including dependency and constraint, and design some algorithms by ourselves to address the novel problem variants.
